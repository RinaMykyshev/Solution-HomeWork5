Flyweight Pattern ‚Äî Map Marker Optimization
 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the Flyweight Design Pattern through a real-world scenario: a map application that needs to render thousands of location markers such as gas stations, restaurants, and hospitals.

Since many markers share the same visual style (icon type, color, label style), we avoid redundant memory usage by sharing those styles using the Flyweight pattern.

Instead of creating duplicate style data for every marker, we share them using a factory (MarkerStyleFactory) that creates and reuses existing style objects (MarkerStyle).
This dramatically reduces memory usage and improves scalability when rendering a large number of objects.

üèó Structure
MarkerStyle.java ‚Äî Flyweight class storing shared marker styles.

MarkerStyleFactory.java ‚Äî Factory class that manages and reuses style instances.

MapMarker.java ‚Äî Context class storing coordinates and referencing a shared style.

Main.java ‚Äî Entry point that creates and draws 10,000 markers, logging memory savings and stats.

 How to Run
Clone or download the project.
